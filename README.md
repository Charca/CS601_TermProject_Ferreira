My term project is a personal digital garden. It is a collection of notes, projects, essays, and other content that I've created, and like a real garden, it is an imperfect environment where things are constantly growing and changing.

My site consists of six pages:
- Index
- About
- The Garden
- Contact
- 2 individual notes in the garden:
  - React 18 useTransition Hook
  - Building Resilient Frontend Architecture

I've used plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website, with the exception of the Garden page, which uses a Vue component to render and filter a list of items.

The site is hosted in Netlify, and it uses [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) to handle the backend for the contact form.
