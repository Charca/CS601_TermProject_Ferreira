            I was born in

            in February of 1989. My parents bought me my first computer when I was 8
            years old, and, a few years later, I put it to good use and built my
            first website using all the power of
            <a

            In 2008, I got my first job as a "Dreamweaver Programmer". That was the
            actual job title. I had a thing for WYSIWYG editors apparently. I spent
            the first few years of my career working as a PHP/SQL Developer, until
            2011 when I switched to a front-end role and I joined
            <a href="https://www.globant.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
              >Globant</a
            >
            to work as a UI Developer. I've been in a love-hate relationship with
            JavaScript ever since.

            In 2015, I joined the amazing

            team, where I currently work as a Senior Engineer, specializing in
            third-party JavaScript applications. I live and work (remotely) from the
            beautiful city of
